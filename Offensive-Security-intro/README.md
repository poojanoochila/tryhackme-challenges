## Overview 

The **Offensive Security Intro** room on TryHackMe provides a beginner-friendly introduction to offensive security and ethical hacking.

The room demonstrates how security professionals think and operate like attackers to identify weaknesses in systems and applications. It includes a practical exercise involving a simulated banking web application, allowing learners to safely perform reconnaissance and identify hidden web application functionality.

> **Note:** All activities were performed in the authorized TryHackMe lab environment.

## Concepts Learned

### Offensive Security

Offensive Security involves simulating real-world attacker behavior to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications.

The goal is not to cause harm, but to discover security issues before malicious attackers can exploit them.

The general process can include:

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Vulnerability Identification
4. Exploitation
5. Reporting and Remediation

## Practical Lab

The practical portion of the room uses a simulated banking application called **FakeBank**.

The objective is to investigate the web application and identify functionality that may not be directly visible from the main page.

The exercise demonstrates how attackers can use web enumeration techniques to discover additional directories and endpoints.
