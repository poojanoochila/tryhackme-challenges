# 🔐 Wazuh – SIEM & XDR (TryHackMe)

## 📌 Overview
Wazuh is an open-source **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** and **XDR (Extended Detection and Response)** platform used in SOC environments for **centralized log collection, correlation, threat detection, and incident response**.

This room demonstrates how security teams monitor endpoints, analyze logs, and detect threats in real time using a **rule-based detection engine**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand Wazuh architecture (Manager, Agent, ELK Stack)
- Perform log collection and normalization
- Analyze alerts and rule-based detections
- Explore HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System)
- Investigate events via dashboard

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Agent → Manager → Elasticsearch → Kibana

- **Wazuh Agent** → Collects logs from endpoints  
- **Wazuh Manager** → Analyzes logs using rules  
- **Elasticsearch** → Stores processed logs  
- **Kibana** → Visualizes alerts and events
