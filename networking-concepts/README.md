## What is a Network?

A network is a collection of devices connected together to exchange information and resources.

Examples include:

- Home Wi-Fi networks
- Corporate networks
- University networks
- The Internet

Networks allow devices such as computers, servers, smartphones, and printers to communicate efficiently.

## IP Addresses

An IP (Internet Protocol) address uniquely identifies a device on a network.

### IPv4 Example

192.168.1.10

IPv4 addresses consist of four octets separated by periods.

### Public IP Addresses

Public IPs are reachable from the Internet and are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

Example:

8.8.8.8

### Private IP Addresses

Private IP addresses are used within local networks and are not directly accessible from the Internet.

Common private ranges:

| Range | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 | Private Networks |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 | Private Networks |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | Home/Office Networks |

---

## MAC Addresses

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC).

Example:

00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Characteristics:

- Layer 2 address
- Used within local networks
- Usually permanently assigned by manufacturers

---

## Ports

Ports allow multiple services to run on a single device.

Common Ports:

| Port | Service |
|--------|---------|
| 21 | FTP |
| 22 | SSH |
| 23 | Telnet |
| 25 | SMTP |
| 53 | DNS |
| 80 | HTTP |
| 110 | POP3 |
| 143 | IMAP |
| 443 | HTTPS |
| 3389 | RDP |

Ports help direct traffic to the appropriate application or service.

---

## Protocols

Protocols define rules for communication between devices.

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

Features:

- Reliable communication
- Error checking
- Connection-oriented

Common uses:

- Web browsing
- Email
- File transfers

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Features:

- Faster communication
- No connection establishment
- Less overhead

Common uses:

- Streaming
- Gaming
- VoIP

---

## DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

Example:

google.com → 142.250.x.x

Without DNS, users would need to remember IP addresses for every website.

DNS acts as the Internet's phonebook.

---

## Common Networking Devices

### Router

Routes traffic between networks and the Internet.

### Switch

Connects devices within the same network and forwards traffic efficiently.

### Firewall

Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.

### Access Point

Provides wireless connectivity to network devices.

---

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model contains seven layers.

| Layer | Function |
|---------|----------|
| 7 | Application |
| 6 | Presentation |
| 5 | Session |
| 4 | Transport |
| 3 | Network |
| 2 | Data Link |
| 1 | Physical |

### Layer Breakdown

#### Application Layer
User-facing services such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

#### Presentation Layer
Handles encryption, compression, and formatting.

#### Session Layer
Manages communication sessions.

#### Transport Layer
Responsible for TCP and UDP communications.

#### Network Layer
Handles IP addressing and routing.

#### Data Link Layer
Uses MAC addresses for local communication.

#### Physical Layer
Transfers raw bits across cables or wireless media.

---

## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is the practical networking model used on the Internet.

| Layer | Responsibilities |
|---------|-----------------|
| Application | User services |
| Transport | TCP / UDP |
| Internet | IP Routing |
| Network Access | Physical transmission |

---

## Packet Transmission Process

When accessing a website:

1. User enters a domain name.
2. DNS resolves the domain to an IP address.
3. TCP connection is established.
4. HTTP/HTTPS request is sent.
5. Server responds with requested data.
6. Browser renders the webpage.

---

## Security Relevance

Networking concepts are foundational for cybersecurity.

Applications include:

- Traffic analysis
- Intrusion detection
- Network monitoring
- Threat hunting
- Incident response
- Penetration testing
- SOC operations

Understanding protocols, ports, IP addressing, and packet flow enables security analysts to identify suspicious activity and investigate attacks effectively.
