# Flask Web Application Security Analysis (SSTI Case Study)

## Overview
This module documents hands-on analysis of a Flask-based web application, focusing on framework fundamentals and security implications of improper template handling.

The objective is to understand how misconfigurations in Flask applications can introduce critical vulnerabilities such as Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which may escalate to Local File Inclusion (LFI) and potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).

---

## Flask Fundamentals

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework designed for rapid development. It provides:

- Minimal setup and configuration
- Built-in development server
- Flexible routing system
- Template rendering using Jinja2

Applications are typically executed by defining an entry point via environment variables and running a local development server.

---

## Application Behavior

- Routes map URLs to Python functions
- Default routes respond to HTTP GET requests
- Additional routes can be defined for modular functionality
- HTTP methods such as GET and POST are supported

---

## Template Rendering and Risk

Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to dynamically render HTML content.

- Template expressions are defined using `{{ }}`
- User input embedded into templates without validation introduces risk

---

## Vulnerability Identified: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

### Description
SSTI occurs when user-controlled input is embedded into a template and interpreted by the template engine.

### Impact
- Access to internal application objects
- Exposure of sensitive data
- File system access (LFI)
- Potential remote code execution in severe cases

---

## Exploitation Overview (Abstracted)

1. Identify user input reflected in templates  
2. Inject template expressions using standard syntax  
3. Access internal variables or functions  
4. Escalate to file access through backend functionality  

*Note: Specific payloads and sensitive outputs are intentionally omitted.*

---

## Security Implications

This case highlights how minor misconfigurations in template rendering can lead to severe exploitation paths in web applications.

---

## Mitigation Strategies

- Avoid rendering unsanitized user input in templates  
- Use safe rendering practices  
- Disable debug mode in production  
- Restrict access to sensitive backend functions  
- Implement input validation and sanitization  

---

## Conclusion

Flask’s simplicity makes it powerful but also introduces risk when security best practices are ignored. Understanding these vulnerabilities is essential for both offensive testing and defensive monitoring.
